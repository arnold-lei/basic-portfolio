#Portfolio Homework Assignment

I decided for this project, to write the CSS from scratch. I did another version of this assignment with Bootstrap: You can find it here:

For this assignment I found that I was a little rusty with CSS and it was really good practice to write the whole thing myself. There are still many things I need to learn. Part of the challenge of this assignment was to try to replicate the screenshots exactly. I took some liberties with ceartain styles but I remained as close to the original designs as possible. I mostly changed the font and text sizes.
