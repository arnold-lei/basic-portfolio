#Portfolio Homework Assignment

I decided for this project, to write the CSS from scratch. I did another version of this assignment with Bootstrap: You can find it here:

For this assignment I found that I was a little rusty with CSS and it was really good practice to write the whole thing myself. There are still many things I need to learn. Part of the challenge of this assignment was to try to replicate the screenshots exactly. I took some liberties with ceartain styles but I remained as close to the original designs as possible. I mostly changed the font and text sizes. 

Challenges

The footer was paticularly challenging. I tried for a very long time to do it with pure CSS but I felt like I was getting no where with it. 
 

The sizing of the panels. I tried to make the website work with the specified dimensions for the hwk but I ended up ditching the width of the outer container. I prefer the extra space between the main content area and the social media panel.
